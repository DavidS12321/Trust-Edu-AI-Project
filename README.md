# AI-Based Polling App: 2nd Grade Math Questions

## Project Description
This project is an AI-based app designed to teach students through polling to improve their second-grade math skills. The app generates math questions that start at an easy level and gradually increase in difficulty as the user answers questions correctly.

### Key Features:
- **Dynamic Difficulty:** The app adapts the difficulty of the questions based on the userâ€™s performance.
- **Math Problem Generation:** The app generates math questions based on second-grade level math concepts. These include simple addition, addition in word problems, and simple multiplication
- **User Feedback:** Users receive immediate feedback to see if they got the question right or wrong.
  
## What I Learned
- **Flask Web Development:** I was able to improve my experience in full-stack web development by using Flask.
- **OpenAI API Integration:** I worked with the OpenAI API to generate dynamic math questions and handle user input.
- **Problem Solving & Debugging:** I improved my ability to debug and troubleshoot issues in the backend and the integration with the OpenAI API.

## Challenges

While I encountered a number of challenges during the development of this project, the biggest hurdle was the integration of the OpenAI API. Although I am on a paid OpenAI plan and have been careful to stay within the usage limits, I faced continuous issues where I was unable to make API calls. I received error messages stating that I had exceeded my quota, despite repeatedly verifying that my usage was within the acceptable limits.

This issue prevented me from demonstrating a fully functional version of the app, as the OpenAI API is critical for generating math questions. I attempted to resolve the issue by reaching out to OpenAI's support team, but the responses I received were largely automated and unhelpful, which further delayed my progress.

## Future Improvements
- **Enhanced Question Variety:** Adding a broader range of question types, reaching to other grade level mathematics.
- **User Profiles:** Implementing user authentication so that each user can track their progress and performance over time.
