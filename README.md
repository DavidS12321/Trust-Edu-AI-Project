# AI-Based Polling App: 2nd Grade Math Questions

**Email for Professor:**  
Dear Dr. Sun,  
I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to explain an issue I have encountered while working on the final stages of my senior project, which is an AI-based polling app that generates second-grade math questions and adjusts difficulty based on user accuracy.  
Unfortunately, despite being on a paid OpenAI plan and confirming multiple times that I am under the API usage limits, I have been experiencing persistent issues with the OpenAI API. Specifically, I am receiving errors indicating that I have exceeded my quota, even though I have verified that this is not the case. I have already made the payment for the API usage, and I am still encountering these errors after several attempts to resolve the issue.  
I have been trying to reach OpenAI’s support team for assistance, but the responses I have received have been unhelpful and automated. This has left me in a situation where I am unable to show a working demo of my app, as it relies heavily on OpenAI's API for generating and responding to the math questions.  
Given the circumstances, I wanted to let you know that while I have completed the app development to the best of my ability, I am currently unable to present a fully functional demo due to the ongoing API issues. I am working on a solution and will continue to troubleshoot, but I wanted to make sure you were aware of the situation in case this affects my grade and submission of the project.  
I deeply appreciate your understanding and patience as I navigate this challenge. If there is any alternative arrangement you would prefer, I am more than happy to discuss it.  
Thank you for your time and consideration.  
Sincerely,  
David Shahi

## Project Description

This project is an AI-based polling app designed to help users practice and improve their second-grade math skills. The app generates math questions that start at an easy level and gradually increase in difficulty as the user answers questions correctly. This allows for personalized learning that adapts to the user’s progress.

### Key Features:
- **Dynamic Difficulty:** The app adapts the difficulty of the questions based on the user’s performance.
- **Math Problem Generation:** The app generates math questions based on second-grade level math concepts.
- **User Feedback:** Users receive immediate feedback to see if they got the question right or wrong.
- 
## What I Learned

- **Flask Web Development:** I gained experience in developing a full-stack web application using Flask, I learned how to handle routes, templates, and user interactions effectively.
- **OpenAI API Integration:** I worked with the OpenAI API to generate dynamic math questions and handle user input.
- **Problem Solving & Debugging:** I honed my ability to debug and troubleshoot issues in both the backend code and the integration with the OpenAI API.

## Challenges

While I encountered a number of challenges during the development of this project, the biggest hurdle was the integration of the OpenAI API. Although I am on a paid OpenAI plan and have been careful to stay within the usage limits, I faced continuous issues where I was unable to make API calls. I received error messages stating that I had exceeded my quota, despite repeatedly verifying that my usage was within the acceptable limits.

This issue prevented me from demonstrating a fully functional version of the app, as the OpenAI API is critical for generating math questions. I attempted to resolve the issue by reaching out to OpenAI's support team, but the responses I received were largely automated and unhelpful, which further delayed my progress. Unfortunately, this meant that I was unable to create a working demo of the app in time for submission.

## Future Improvements

While the app is currently functional to a basic degree, there are several areas for future improvement, including:

- **Enhanced Question Variety:** Adding a broader range of question types, reaching to other grade level mathematics.
- **User Profiles:** Implementing user authentication so that each user can track their progress and performance over time.
